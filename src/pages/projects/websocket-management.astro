      As an AWS intern I owned the research-to-recommendation lifecycle for a scalable WebSocket platform: I evaluated frameworks, built POCs,
      authored design docs, ran review sessions with senior engineers, and proposed the architecture that met every use case while reinforcing bias for
      action, collaboration, and adaptability.

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Proof-of-concept services benchmarking three different frameworks under 6K+ concurrent sessions and 8MB payloads.</li>
        <li>Production-ready throttling, persistence, and failover flows that reduced disconnects by 35% in chaos testing.</li>
        <li>Detailed runbooks, dashboards, and SLOs so on-call engineers could react within minutes.</li>
      </ul>

        The project taught me how to stay independent while keeping stakeholders aligned, how to gather feedback from senior engineers quickly, and how
        to drive a solution from ambiguous requirements to a clear architecture recommendation.
