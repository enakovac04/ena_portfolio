      As an AWS intern I owned the research-to-recommendation lifecycle for a scalable WebSocket platform: I evaluated frameworks, built POCs,
      authored design docs, ran review sessions with senior engineers, and proposed the architecture that met every use case while reinforcing bias for
      action, collaboration, and adaptability.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What I built</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Developed proof-of-concept services using three different WebSocket frameworks, benchmarking 6K+ concurrent
          sessions and 8&nbsp;MB payloads on AWS ECS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ran architecture review discussions with developers and principal engineers to analyze scalability, reliability,
          and operational complexity trade-offs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interviewed senior engineers across teams already using these frameworks to understand real-world failure modes,
          performance bottlenecks, and operational pain points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Performed deep codebase analysis of prior WebSocket implementations to evaluate design patterns, state
          management strategies, and extensibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Delivered presentations and written design summaries that aligned stakeholders on a recommended architecture for
          a scalable, fault-tolerant WebSocket platform.
        </li>
      </ul>

        This project taught me how to stay independent while keeping stakeholders aligned, how to quickly gather feedback
        from senior engineers, and how to drive an ambiguous problem from open-ended research to a clear, data-backed
        architecture recommendation.
