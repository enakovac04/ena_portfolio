      Architected and deployed a SQL-style database managing 100K+ records, implementing core relational operators
      and a dynamic query planner that selects efficient algorithms across different dataset sizes.

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Implemented core relational operators (selection, projection, joins) on top of a custom Java storage layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built and compared tuple nested loop join and block nested loop join, benchmarking their performance across
          varying table sizes and join selectivities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed basic indexing and statistics collection to speed up lookups and inform query-planning decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed a query planner that chooses join algorithms and access paths based on dataset size and available
          resources, automatically adapting from small (1K) to large (100K+) tables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added a test harness and integration tests to validate correctness across edge cases and prevent regressions
          as new operators were added.
        </li>
      </ul>

        This project gave me hands-on experience with how databases actually execute queries under the hood—how join
        algorithms behave at different scales, how indexing and statistics influence performance, and how a query
        planner can turn a declarative SQL request into an efficient execution plan.
