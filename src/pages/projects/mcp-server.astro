    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
      Built an MCP server integrating 38 internal APIs to automate UI workflows end-to-end. The system reduced manual 
      interaction time by ~30% by enabling typed or voice-based natural-language requests and executing the required
      workflow safely, consistently, and asynchronously.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What I built</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Implemented a natural-language interface supporting both typed commands and real-time voice transcription, 
          enabling anyone to trigger complex workflows through simple requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrated 38 internal APIs powering actions like “accept call,” “update record,” and other UI-heavy workflows,
          replacing slow manual clicking with reliable automation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Engineered asynchronous MCP tools allowing multiple API calls to execute in parallel, significantly cutting 
          workflow time for independent operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built a dependency-mapping system to determine which API calls could run concurrently vs. sequentially, 
          optimizing latency while guaranteeing correctness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Delivered weekly demos to product teams and senior engineers, validating use cases, gathering feedback, and 
          highlighting measurable time savings.
        </li>

        This project taught me how to design automation pipelines that scale across multiple teams, how to build robust 
        asynchronous tools, and how to communicate clearly in demos and stakeholder syncs while continuously iterating 
        on feedback. I also learned how to model workflow dependencies and optimize execution for performance and safety.
