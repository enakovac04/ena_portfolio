        Hello World! I'm a Computer Science student at Cornell with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. My work focuses on backend engineering and applied machine learning, including large-scale systems at Amazon Web Services and automation and NLP projects at Samsung SDS and American Express. I enjoy building reliable, data-driven systems and machine learning models that perform in real-world settings.
